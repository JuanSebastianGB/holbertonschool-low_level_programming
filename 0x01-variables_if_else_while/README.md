### Tasks

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c) - This function print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
- [1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c) - This program will print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c) - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c) - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
