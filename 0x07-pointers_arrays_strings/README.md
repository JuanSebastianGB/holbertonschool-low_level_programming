# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

### Learning objectives

- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

### Tasks

- [0-memset.c](0-memset.c) - function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- [1-memcpy.c](1-memcpy.c) - function that copies memory area.
- [2-strchr.c](2-strchr.c) - function that locates a character in a string.
- [3-strspn.c](3-strspn.c) - function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- [4-strpbrk.c](4-strpbrk.c) - function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- [5-strstr.c](5-strstr.c) - function that locates a substring.
- [7-print_chessboard.c](7-print_chessboard.c) - function that prints the chessboard.
- [8-print_diagsums.c](8-print_diagsums.c) - function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
